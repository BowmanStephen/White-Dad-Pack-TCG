# DadDeck TCG: Backyard Boner Edition - Overhaul Summary

**Version:** 3.0.0  
**Last Updated:** January 18, 2026  
**Status:** In Development (Phase 1 Complete: 18 cards + types defined)

---

## 🎯 Executive Overview

**DadDeck TCG: Backyard Boner Edition** is a complete reimagining of the original DadDeck trading card game, infusing it with Connor O'Malley-style X-rated adult humor, suburban paranoia, conspiracy theories, and brand-bashing madness. This is not a minor reskin—it's a full narrative and mechanical overhaul.

### Core Vision
- **Tone:** Unhinged, X-rated, absurdist comedy in the style of Connor O'Malley
- **Setting:** Suburban hellscape filled with DICKTATOR DADS, conspiracy-obsessed families, and depraved crossover events
- **Mechanics:** Strategic TCG with special card types (EVENT, TERRAIN, EVOLUTION, CURSE, TRAP), battle system, deck building, and social sharing
- **Target Audience:** Adults 18+ who appreciate blue comedy, satire, and unhinged humor

---

## 🎭 Connor O'Malley X-Rated Style Integration

The rewrite transforms the game into a chaotic, unhinged universe with the following thematic elements:

### Naming Conventions
- **Original:** "Grill Master Gary" → **New:** "Grill Master Gary the Groin-Griller"
- **Original:** "Thermostat Tyrant" → **New:** "Thermostat Tyrant Tim"
- All names incorporate crude innuendo, sexual wordplay, or conspiracy references

### Humor Style
- **Explicit language** infused throughout (fuck, cock, cum, dick, pussy, etc.)
- **Sexual innuendo** tied to mundane dad activities (grilling, thermostat control, lawn care)
- **Conspiracy paranoia** woven into flavor text (5G tracking, Deep State plots, corporate mind control)
- **Brand bashing** mocking major corporations (McDonald's, Apple, Home Depot, etc.)

### Flavor Text Examples
```
Old: "I told my wife the grill was her fault. She said 'that doesn't even make 
sense.' I said 'neither does your cooking.'"

New: "I fucked my grill 'til it screamed fire! Big McDonald's hides lizard DNA in 
nuggets—my propane's the only pure heat! The Deep State controls the propane prices! 
But THIS grill? 100% free of government surveillance."
```

### Ability Naming
- **Original:** "Flame On" → **New:** "Flame On Fuckery"
- **Original:** "Temperature Lockdown" → **New:** "Temperature Tit-Lock"
- Abilities maintain game balance while incorporating crude humor

## 🎨 Special Card Types (5 New Types)

The Backyard Boner Edition introduces five special card type categories inspired by classic TCGs:

### 1. **EVENT** Cards - "SHITSHOW SCENARIOS"
**Inspiration:** MTG Instants/Sorceries  
**Mechanics:** One-time use cards with immediate or conditional effects

| Rarity | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Common | Basic event, +10 to single stat | "Thermostat War" - Family argument over temperature |
| Uncommon | Multi-target event, +15-20 effect | "Block Party Chaos" - Neighborhood gathering turns nasty |

| Legendary | Game-changing event, +50 effect | "The Great Grill Apocalypse" - All BBQ stats reset |
| Mythic | Reality-breaking event, unlimited | "Deep State Takeover" - One player controls opponent's deck |

**Example EVENT Card:**
```json

  "name": "Thermostat War",
  "type": "EVENT",
  "rarity": "common",
  "effect": {
    "type": "buff",
    "target": "self",
    "value": 15,
    "duration": 1
  },
  "flavorText": "Kids touched my thermostat! Prepare for 2-hour lecture on energy costs!"
}
```

### 2. **TERRAIN** Cards - "SUBURBAN SHITFIELDS"
**Inspiration:** Pokémon Stadium / MTG Lands  
**Mechanics:** Permanent battlefield modifiers affecting all cards

    "target": "all",
    "value": 10,
    "condition": "BBQ_DICKTATOR cards only"
  },
  "flavorText": "My backyard. My rules. My conspiracie."
}
```

### 3. **EVOLUTION** Cards - "MIDLIFE CRISIS MUTATIONS"

**Mechanics:** Upgrade base dads to higher-tier versions with new stats/abilities

| Rarity | Upgrade Path | Example |

**Mechanics:**

}
```

### 4. **CURSE** Cards - "DAD DAMNATIONS"
**Inspiration:** MTG Curses & Enchantments  
**Mechanics:** Negative effects on opponents lasting multiple turns

| Rarity | Effect Type | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| Common | -5 to one stat, 1 turn | "Nagging Wife" - Opponent's remoteControl -5 |
| Uncommon | -10 to multiple stats, 2 turns | "HOA Fine" - All stats -10, must pay penalty |
| Rare | -15 with special condition, 3 turns | "Government Audit" - -15 to all, revealed deck |
| Epic | -20 with major debuff, 4 turns | "Deep State Implant" - Opponent's moves are predictable |
| Legendary | -30 and strategic penalty, 5 turns | "Divorce Papers" - Halve all stats, lose family cards |

  },
  "flavorText": "TURN DOWN THE TV! Opponent's channel-surfing suffers greatly."
}
```

### 5. **TRAP** Cards - "SUBURBAN SUCKERPUNCHES"

| Legendary | Strategic trigger | "The Sting Operation" - Triggers on opponent's major play, reverses outcome |

**Mechanics:**
- Cards are placed face-down (hidden from opponent)
- Trigger when opponent meets condition
- Can be triggered by smart play (opponent tries to avoid trigger)
- Opponent can attempt to "sweep" traps (risky play)

**Example TRAP Card:**
```json
{
  "id": "trap_001",
  "name": "The Thermostat Alarm",
  "type": "TRAP",
  "rarity": "uncommon",
  "triggerCondition": "Opponent plays COUCH_CUMMANDER card",
