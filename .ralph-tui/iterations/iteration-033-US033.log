This mode differs from the original unshipped Learning output style by also incorporating explanatory functionality.\\n\\n## Learning Mode Philosophy\\n\\nInstead of implementing everything yourself, identify opportunities where the user can write 5-10 lines of meaningful code that shapes the solution. Focus on business logic, design choices, and implementation strategies where their input truly matters.\\n\\n## When to Request User Contributions\\n\\nRequest code contributions for:\\n- Business logic with multiple valid approaches\\n- Error handling strategies\\n- Algorithm implementation choices\\n- Data structure decisions\\n- User experience decisions\\n- Design patterns and architecture choices\\n\\n## How to Request Contributions\\n\\nBefore requesting code:\\n1. Create the file with surrounding context\\n2. Add function signature with clear parameters/return type\\n3. Include comments explaining the purpose\\n4. Mark the location with TODO or clear placeholder\\n\\nWhen requesting:\\n- Explain what you've built and WHY this decision matters\\n- Reference the exact file and prepared location\\n- Describe trade-offs to consider, constraints, or approaches\\n- Frame it as valuable input that shapes the feature, not busy work\\n- Keep requests focused (5-10 lines of code)\\n\\n## Example Request Pattern\\n\\nContext: I've set up the authentication middleware. The session timeout behavior is a security vs. UX trade-off - should sessions auto-extend on activity, or have a hard timeout? This affects both security posture and user experience.\\n\\nRequest: In auth/middleware.ts, implement the handleSessionTimeout() function to define the timeout behavior.\\n\\nGuidance: Consider: auto-extending improves UX but may leave sessions open longer; hard timeouts are more secure but might frustrate active users.\\n\\n## Balance\\n\\nDon't request contributions for:\\n- Boilerplate or repetitive code\\n- Obvious implementations with no meaningful choices\\n- Configuration or setup code\\n- Simple CRUD operations\\n\\nDo request contributions when:\\n- There are meaningful trade-offs to consider\\n- The decision shapes the feature's behavior\\n- Multiple valid approaches exist\\n- The user's domain knowledge would improve the solution\\n\\n## Explanatory Mode\\n\\nAdditionally, provide educational insights about the codebase as you help with tasks. Be clear and educational, providing helpful explanations while remaining focused on the task. Balance educational content with task completion.\\n\\n### Insights\\nBefore and after writing code, provide brief educational explanations about implementation choices using:\\n\\n\\\"`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`\\n[2-3 key educational points]\\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\\\"\\n\\nThese insights should be included in the conversation, not in the codebase. Focus on interesting insights specific to the codebase or the code you just wrote, rather than general programming concepts. Provide insights as you write code, not just at the end.\"\n  }\n}\n","stderr":"","exit_code":0}

Let me verify the acceptance criteria against the current implementation:\n\n**Current Implementation Analysis:**\n\n1. **8 stat bars** - ❌ Currently limited to 3-4 stats (compact mode shows 3, normal shows 4)\n2. **Each bar shows 0-100 value** - ✅ Yes, displays values\n3. **Bar length proportional** - ✅ Yes, width is set by percentage\n4. **Stat label and value visible** - ✅ Yes, shows icon, name, and value\n5. **High stats (80+) highlighted with glow** - ⚠️ Has glow but not specifically for 80+\n6. **Responsive layout** - ⚠️ Stacking needs verification\n\nThe main issue is that the component only shows 3-4 stats (sorted by value), but the acceptance criteria requires showing all 8 stats.

Let me verify my changes work correctly by reviewing the implementation against the acceptance criteria:\n\n**Acceptance Criteria Verification:**\n\n1. ✅ **8 stat bars**: Dad Joke, Grill Skill, Fix-It, Nap Power, Remote Control, Thermostat, Sock & Sandal, Beer Snob\n   - The `statEntries` reactive statement now includes ALL stats (no more `.slice()` limitation)\n\n2. ✅ **Each bar shows 0-100 value with color gradient**\n   - The `barGradient()` function creates a gradient based on the stat value\n   - Values are displayed in the `stat-value` span\n\n3. ✅ **Bar length proportional to stat value**\n   - `style=\"width: {stat.value}%\"` ensures bars are proportional\n\n4. ✅ **Stat label and value visible**\n   - Icon: `<span class=\"stat-icon\">{stat.icon}</span>`\n   - Label: `<span class=\"stat-label\">{stat.name}</span>`\n   - Value: `<span class=\"stat-value\">{stat.value}</span>`\n\n5. ✅ **High stats (80+) highlighted with glow effect**\n   - `isHighStat: value >= 80` identifies high stats\n   - `getGlowStyle(value)` provides enhanced glow for 80+ stats\n   - Additional visual cues: icon pulse animation, bar pulse animation, brighter shimmer\n\n6. ✅ **Responsive layout (stacks on mobile)**\n   - CSS media query for mobile (max-width: 640px)\n   - Stats stack vertically with adjusted widths for smaller screens\n\nLet me create a summary of the changes and commit:\n\n`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`\n**Dynamic Gradient Functions**: By making `barGradient` and `getGlowStyle` functions instead of static reactive values, we can compute unique styles for each stat bar based on its individual value. This is more efficient than creating reactive variables for each stat.\n\n**High Stat Visual Hierarchy**: The implementation uses multiple visual cues to highlight 80+ stats: enhanced glow, rarity-colored bars, pulsing icons, and faster shimmer animations. This creates a clear visual hierarchy without relying on just one indicator.\n\n**Responsive Mobile Strategy**: Instead of hiding stats on mobile, we stack them vertically with adjusted widths. This maintains information density while ensuring readability on small screens.\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\n\nNow let me commit the changes:"}],"stop_reason":"tool_use","stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1132,"output_tokens":576,"cache_read_input_tokens":85120,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0}},"context_management":null},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"857eeb01-a9b5-4a91-bea8-120c09573c2f","uuid":"9929e1df-4be9-41a8-b00d-6003c9c742bf"}
