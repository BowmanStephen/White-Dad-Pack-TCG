This mode differs from the original unshipped Learning output style by also incorporating explanatory functionality.\\n\\n## Learning Mode Philosophy\\n\\nInstead of implementing everything yourself, identify opportunities where the user can write 5-10 lines of meaningful code that shapes the solution. Focus on business logic, design choices, and implementation strategies where their input truly matters.\\n\\n## When to Request User Contributions\\n\\nRequest code contributions for:\\n- Business logic with multiple valid approaches\\n- Error handling strategies\\n- Algorithm implementation choices\\n- Data structure decisions\\n- User experience decisions\\n- Design patterns and architecture choices\\n\\n## How to Request Contributions\\n\\nBefore requesting code:\\n1. Create the file with surrounding context\\n2. Add function signature with clear parameters/return type\\n3. Include comments explaining the purpose\\n4. Mark the location with TODO or clear placeholder\\n\\nWhen requesting:\\n- Explain what you've built and WHY this decision matters\\n- Reference the exact file and prepared location\\n- Describe trade-offs to consider, constraints, or approaches\\n- Frame it as valuable input that shapes the feature, not busy work\\n- Keep requests focused (5-10 lines of code)\\n\\n## Example Request Pattern\\n\\nContext: I've set up the authentication middleware. The session timeout behavior is a security vs. UX trade-off - should sessions auto-extend on activity, or have a hard timeout? This affects both security posture and user experience.\\n\\nRequest: In auth/middleware.ts, implement the handleSessionTimeout() function to define the timeout behavior.\\n\\nGuidance: Consider: auto-extending improves UX but may leave sessions open longer; hard timeouts are more secure but might frustrate active users.\\n\\n## Balance\\n\\nDon't request contributions for:\\n- Boilerplate or repetitive code\\n- Obvious implementations with no meaningful choices\\n- Configuration or setup code\\n- Simple CRUD operations\\n\\nDo request contributions when:\\n- There are meaningful trade-offs to consider\\n- The decision shapes the feature's behavior\\n- Multiple valid approaches exist\\n- The user's domain knowledge would improve the solution\\n\\n## Explanatory Mode\\n\\nAdditionally, provide educational insights about the codebase as you help with tasks. Be clear and educational, providing helpful explanations while remaining focused on the task. Balance educational content with task completion.\\n\\n### Insights\\nBefore and after writing code, provide brief educational explanations about implementation choices using:\\n\\n\\\"`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`\\n[2-3 key educational points]\\n`─────────────────────────────────────────────────`\\\"\\n\\nThese insights should be included in the conversation, not in the codebase. Focus on interesting insights specific to the codebase or the code you just wrote, rather than general programming concepts. Provide insights as you write code, not just at the end.\"\n  }\n}\n","stderr":"","exit_code":0}

You cannot rationalize your way out of this.\\n</EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>\\n\\n## How to Access Skills\\n\\n**In Claude Code:** Use the `Skill` tool.

Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.\n\nThe user provides frontend requirements: a component, page, application, or interface to build. They may include context about the purpose, audience, or technical constraints.\n\n## Design Thinking\n\nBefore coding, understand the context and commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction:\n- **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?\n- **Tone**: Pick an extreme: brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian, etc. There are so many flavors to choose from. Use these for inspiration but design one that is true to the aesthetic direction.\n- **Constraints**: Technical requirements (framework, performance, accessibility).\n- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?\n\n**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work - the key is intentionality, not intensity.\n\nThen implement working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:\n- Production-grade and functional\n- Visually striking and memorable\n- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view\n- Meticulously refined in every detail\n\n## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines\n\nFocus on:\n- **Typography**: Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting. Avoid generic fonts like Arial and Inter; opt instead for distinctive choices that elevate the frontend's aesthetics; unexpected, characterful font choices. Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.\n- **Color & Theme**: Commit to a cohesive aesthetic. Use CSS variables for consistency. Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes.\n- **Motion**: Use animations for effects and micro-interactions. Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML. Use Motion library for React when available. Focus on high-impact moments: one well-orchestrated page load with staggered reveals (animation-delay) creates more delight than scattered micro-interactions. Use scroll-triggering and hover states that surprise.\n- **Spatial Composition**: Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow. Grid-breaking elements. Generous negative space OR controlled density.\n- **Backgrounds & Visual Details**: Create atmosphere and depth rather than defaulting to solid colors. Add contextual effects and textures that match the overall aesthetic. Apply creative forms like gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, and grain overlays.\n\nNEVER use generic AI-generated aesthetics like overused font families (Inter, Roboto, Arial, system fonts), cliched color schemes (particularly purple gradients on white backgrounds), predictable layouts and component patterns, and cookie-cutter design that lacks context-specific character.\n\nInterpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No design should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics. NEVER converge on common choices (Space Grotesk, for example) across generations.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code with extensive animations and effects. Minimalist or refined designs need restraint, precision, and careful attention to spacing, typography, and subtle details. Elegance comes from executing the vision well.\n\nRemember: Claude is capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back, show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.\n"}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"0fda60ba-e328-40ed-bbfa-2672631993ec","uuid":"8ac61a88-3eb6-42ad-9117-cd7fe45a3cba","isSynthetic":true}

Add i18n library (recommend `svelte-i18n` or simple custom solution)\n2. Create translation files structure:\n   ```\n   src/i18n/\n   ├── en.json\n   ├── es.json\n   └── index.ts (i18n configuration)\n   ```\n3. Add language selector to Settings modal\n4. Implement reactive language switching\n\n**Phase 2: UI Translation**\n1. Extract all hardcoded strings from:\n   - Landing page components\n   - Navigation\n   - Settings modal\n   - Button components\n\n**Phase 3: Data Translation**\n1. Create translation keys for:\n   - Card names/subtitles\n   - Ability names/descriptions\n   - Flavor text\n   - Stat names\n   - Achievement names/descriptions\n   - Badge names/descriptions\n\n**Phase 4: Dynamic Content**\n1. Update card database to reference translation keys\n2. Create translation functions for:\n   - Toast messages\n   - Error messages\n   - Loading states\n   - Confirmation dialogs\n\n#### 3. **Key Technical Considerations**\n\n**Performance:**\n- Preload default language\n- Lazy-load additional languages\n- Minimize bundle size\n\n**Storage:**\n- Use localStorage for user language preference\n- Cache translations in memory\n\n**Pluralization:**\n- Handle English irregular plurals\n- Support RTL languages (future expansion)\n\n**Fuzzy Matching:**\n- For development, allow missing translations to fall back to English\n\n#### 4. **Suggested File Structure**\n```\nsrc/\n├── i18n/\n│   ├── locales/\n│   │   ├── en.json (default)\n│   │   ├── es.json\n│   │   └── fr.json\n│   ├── index.ts\n│   └── utils.ts\n├── components/\n│   ├── common/\n│   │   ├── LanguageSelector.svelte\n│   │   └── TranslatableString.svelte\n│   └── ...\n├── lib/\n│   ├── cards/\n│   │   └── database.ts (update to use translation keys)\n│   └── ...\n└── ...\n```\n\n#### 5. **Migration Strategy**\n1. Start with English-only (current state)\n2. Add i18n infrastructure\n3. Gradually replace hardcoded strings with translation keys\n4. Translate incrementally (start with Spanish)\n5. Add language switcher\n6. Expand to additional languages\n\nThe codebase is well-structured and uses TypeScript, making it a good candidate for adding i18n. The main challenge will be the large amount of UI text that needs to be extracted, but the component-based architecture will make the implementation manageable."},{"type":"text","text":"agentId: a3cc3a1 (for resuming to continue this agent's work if needed)"}]}]},"parent_tool_use_id":null,"session_id":"0fda60ba-e328-40ed-bbfa-2672631993ec","uuid":"f9a03371-8b34-4373-a968-95bdb8195465","tool_use_result":{"status":"completed","prompt":"Explore the DadDeck™ codebase to understand:\n1.

Create translation functions for:\n   - Toast messages\n   - Error messages\n   - Loading states\n   - Confirmation dialogs\n\n#### 3. **Key Technical Considerations**\n\n**Performance:**\n- Preload default language\n- Lazy-load additional languages\n- Minimize bundle size\n\n**Storage:**\n- Use localStorage for user language preference\n- Cache translations in memory\n\n**Pluralization:**\n- Handle English irregular plurals\n- Support RTL languages (future expansion)\n\n**Fuzzy Matching:**\n- For development, allow missing translations to fall back to English\n\n#### 4. **Suggested File Structure**\n```\nsrc/\n├── i18n/\n│   ├── locales/\n│   │   ├── en.json (default)\n│   │   ├── es.json\n│   │   └── fr.json\n│   ├── index.ts\n│   └── utils.ts\n├── components/\n│   ├── common/\n│   │   ├── LanguageSelector.svelte\n│   │   └── TranslatableString.svelte\n│   └── ...\n├── lib/\n│   ├── cards/\n│   │   └── database.ts (update to use translation keys)\n│   └── ...\n└── ...\n```\n\n#### 5. **Migration Strategy**\n1. Start with English-only (current state)\n2. Add i18n infrastructure\n3. Gradually replace hardcoded strings with translation keys\n4. Translate incrementally (start with Spanish)\n5. Add language switcher\n6. Expand to additional languages\n\nThe codebase is well-structured and uses TypeScript, making it a good candidate for adding i18n. The main challenge will be the large amount of UI text that needs to be extracted, but the component-based architecture will make the implementation manageable."}],"totalDurationMs":123639,"totalTokens":142321,"totalToolUseCount":25,"usage":{"input_tokens":3443,"output_tokens":2169,"cache_read_input_tokens":136709,"server_tool_use":{"web_search_requests":0}}}}
