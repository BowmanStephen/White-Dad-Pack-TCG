    "usage_age_content": "DadDeck™ is suitable for all ages, but we recommend players be at least 13 years old. Younger players should have parental supervision. Why? Because some of the humor might go over kids' heads, and we don't want to explain dad jokes to a confused 8-year-old.",

(2) Abusive behavior toward other players or our team. (3) Attempting to exploit or harm the game. (4) Being a total buzzkill. Upon termination, your right to use the game will immediately cease.

We'll notify players of significant changes through: (1) In-game notifications. (2) Updates to our website. (3) Social media posts.
