## Connor O'Malley Tone & Style Guidelines

All cards maintain the unhinged, X-rated aesthetic:

### Naming Conventions
- Sexual innuendo in names (Gary → "Groin-Griller", Tim → "Tit-Clicker")
- Adjectives reference body parts & crude humor
- Subtitles drip with conspiracy theories & dad clichés

### Flavor Text Requirements
- Mix explicit sex jokes with government conspiracy theories
- Reference brand names with paranoid accusations
- Include "Big [Industry]" conspiracies (Big McDonald's, Big HVAC, etc.)
- 2-3 sentences max, punchy and depraved

### Ability Names
- Sexual puns + mechanic description
- Example: "Flame On Fuckery", "Temperature Tit-Lock", "Perfect Heat Hump"

### Stats Balance
- BBQ_DICKTATOR: High grillSkill (80-100)
- COUCH_CUMMANDER: High remoteControl & thermostat
- LAWN_LUNATIC: Varied, theme-appropriate
- All dads have dadJoke between 60-100 (thematic)

## Integration with Game System

### Type System
The `type` field is critical for:
- Pack generation rarity slots
- Deck building validation rules
- Battle mechanics (type advantages)
- Achievement triggers
- Event-specific card filtering

### Rarity System
- **Common** (30%): Base dads, standard items
- **Uncommon** (25%): Enhanced dads, upgraded items
- **Rare** (28%): Strong dads, legendary items
- **Epic** (14%): Premium dads, crossover items
- **Legendary** (2%): Mythic dads, signature items
- **Mythic** (1%): The Ultimate Dicktator Daddy (rarest pull)

### Stats Philosophy
- Each stat represents a "dad skill" (0-100 scale)
- Stat totals typically 500-700 across a card
- Rarity doesn't always mean higher stats (balance for gameplay)
- Thematic stats: BBQ dad has high grillSkill regardless of rarity
