# Connor O'Malley Voice Guide - Chicagoland Edition

## For DadDeck Card Rewrite

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1. EVERYTHING IS A PERSONAL CRISIS

No neutral statements. Everything is either a triumph or a betrayal.

### 2. HYPER-SPECIFIC LOCATION REFERENCES

- Lake Bluff (hero location)
- Lake Forest (rival/enemy)
- Sunset Foods (Lake Bluff's fancy grocery)
- Mariano's (Lake Forest's grocery - inferior)
- Home Depot Libertyville (forbidden zone)
- Westfield Old Orchard (Skokie - the mall)
- Union Pacific North Metra line
- Specific streets: McHenry Ave, Scarlet Oak Drive

### 3. THE SUBURBAN HIERARCHY (Comedy Gold)

Lake Bluff > Lake Forest > Winnetka > Wilmette > Libertyville > Naperville (punching bag)

### 4. MANIC DEFENSE PHRASES

- "I'm not crazy, YOU'RE CRAZY!"
- "This is NORMAL behavior!"
- "My WIFE says I need help but SHE doesn't understand the VISION!"
- "I'M LIVING MY TRUTH!"
- "BABY!" (aggressive, not affectionate)
- "CHECK IT OUT!" (before revealing something insane)

### 5. THE ESCALATION STRUCTURE

[Observation] → [Specific Complaint] → [Absurd Conclusion] → [Manic Defense]

### 6. BRAND OBSESSION

Name exact models, stores, locations:

- Not "a grill" → "Weber Genesis II E-335 from Sunset Foods"
- Not "the store" → "Home Depot in Libertyville, NOT the one in Gurnee"

### 7. METRA TRAIN CULTURE

- Union Pacific North line from Lake Bluff
- Specific conductors know him
- Banned from specific trains
- Quiet car violations

### 8. THE WIFE AS FOIL

She represents "society" trying to suppress suburban dad vision.
